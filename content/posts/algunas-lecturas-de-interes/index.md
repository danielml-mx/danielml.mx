Comparto aquí algunas lecturas y artículos breves que
considero particularmente relevantes para realmente
comprender el estado político actual del mundo. En el
verdadero espíritu del anarquismo epistemológico, su
inclusión aquí no necesariamente indica que esté
completamente de acuerdo con ellas, mucho menos que promuevo
su fuente, pero sí que contienen ideas que opino deben ser
más comunes en el discurso político actual.

- [Industrial Society and Its Future](http://editions-hache.com/essais/pdf/kaczynski2.pdf) --- Theodore Kaczynski
    - *"Our society tends to regard as a “sickness” any mode of thought or behavior that is inconvenient for the system, and this is plausible because when an individual doesn’t fit into the system it causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the system. Thus the manipulation of an individual to adjust him to the system is seen as a “cure” for a “sickness” and therefore as good."*

- [The System's Neatest Trick](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-system-s-neatest-trick) --- Theodore Kaczynski
    -  *"The System has played a trick on today's would-be revolutionaries and rebels. The trick is so cute that if it had been consciously planned one would have to admire it for its almost mathematical elegance."*

- [Google's Ideological Echo Chamber](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf) --- James Damore
    - *"Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold  by shaming dissenters into silence. This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian policies."*

        - <u>Nota personal</u>: Antes de cambiarme de
          carrera, cuando estudiaba una ingeniería en
          desarrollo de software, era bien sabido que Google
          sólo contrataba mujeres para sus internships. No
          veo cómo esto no constituye discriminación. La
          justicia demanda simetría.

- [Free Software Is Even More Important Now](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html) --- Richard Stallman
    - *"When a program respects users' freedom and community, we call it “free software.”"*


- [Are Boys Irrational?](http://web.archive.org/web/20131217120442/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304403804579262291294720488) --- James Taranto
    - *"Men traditionally sought to “better themselves” not because working in an office or on an assembly line was itself a source of delight, but because being a workingman enabled them to earn respect and made possible the joys of domestic life."*

- [Pump and Dump](https://radishmag.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/pump-and-dump/) --- Radish Mag
    - *"Men traditionally sought to “better themselves” not because working in an office or on an assembly line was itself a source of delight, but because being a workingman enabled them to earn respect and made possible the joys of domestic life."*
