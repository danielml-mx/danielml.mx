[{"content":"¿Cómo definirías tú la palabra \u0026lsquo;racional\u0026rsquo;? Más importante aún, ¿cómo distingues entre algo que es racional y algo que es irracional?\nSi piensas en términos de la \u0026ldquo;sabiduría\u0026rdquo; moderna, terminarás estableciendo que aquello que es racional es aquello que se puede concluir a través de la lógica. Esta definición parece bastante benigna, pero al adherirse a su letra y no a su espíritu termina siendo, irónicamente, el fallo de lógica de muchos argumentos contemporáneos. En este artículo exploraré aquellos fallos que conciernen la gobernanza de una sociedad y por qué seguir la tradición es más racional que seguir la propia razón.\nLos límites del racionalismo Si quieres saber por qué nuestra sociedad funciona bajo un modelo arriba-abajo donde los académicos, burócratas, tecnócratas y en general los nerdos son quienes dictan cómo debemos pensar y cuáles deben ser nuestros valores \u0026mdash;en lugar de las personas que tienen un trabajo de verdad\u0026mdash;, es gracias a los principios del racionalismo. Colectivamente, y en términos epistemológicos, hemos decidido que la razón es una fuente de conocimiento superior al resto, por encima de la fe, la tradición y la experiencia sensorial, y hemos coronado a los \u0026ldquo;intelectuales\u0026rdquo; supremos portadores de esta. Dicho de una manera más técnica, aplicamos excesivamente la teoría de las formas de Platón al esperar que los \u0026ldquo;intelectuales\u0026rdquo; nos revelen la verdadera Forma de la sociedad y cómo volverla una realidad.\nEl problema con esta idea es que presupone que los humanos somos lo suficientemente inteligentes como para entender nuestro entorno y cómo debe funcionar, cuando en realidad nunca comprenderemos el mundo de manera integral. Por un lado, la realidad (y por extensión, la realidad social) es emergente, mucho más que la suma de sus partes, y simplemente demasiado grande y compleja, con demasiados mecanismos y variables operando e interactuando entre sí simultáneamente, y por el otro, nosotros evolucionamos principalmente para sobrevivir, no para comprender el mundo; sólo lo hacemos en la medida en que sea útil, por lo cual incluso (especialmente) los \u0026ldquo;intelectuales\u0026rdquo; fracasan al intentar generar teorías integrales de la sociedad y, en lugar de explicar, terminan por reducir la sociedad a algo que en realidad no es.\nEl rol de la tradición Este último punto es crucial, pues mucho de lo que hoy hacemos para dirigir nuestra sociedad consiste en deshacer o \u0026ldquo;deconstruir\u0026rdquo; tradiciones, costumbres y heurísticas de pensamiento que se declaran \u0026ldquo;irracionales\u0026rdquo; simplemente porque no somos capaces de comprenderlas, pero el hecho de que no las comprendamos no significa que no sean esenciales para el correcto funcionamiento de nuestra sociedad.\nUn excelente ejemplo de esto son las actitudes en torno al matrimonio. Hace un par de generaciones nadie hubiera disputado que el matrimonio constituye uno de los pilares de la civilización, pues evidentemente es una práctica que ha sobrevivido a través del tiempo precisamente porque ha traído estabilidad a la sociedad a través de las familias nucleares y extendidas. Hoy en día, sin embargo, no sólo hemos desprestigiado severamente la práctica, sino que se nos pide deconstruirla y estimar \u0026ldquo;familias alternativas\u0026rdquo; al mismo nivel que la familia tradicional, pues, en un sentido racionalista, en teoría no hay nada que un solo padre o una sola madre no pueda proveerle a sus hijos. Desafortunadamente, en la práctica, la ausencia de uno de estos ejemplos a seguir es prácticamente lo peor que le puede pasar a un hijo.\nLo que los \u0026ldquo;expertos\u0026rdquo; no logran ver en casos como este es que aquello que es lógico es, en el mejor de los casos, tan complejo como permite la capacidad computacional de un solo cerebro humano, mientras que aquello que es tradicional, consuetudinario e incluso lo que es mitológico/religioso es supraracional; son algo así como grandes heurísticas de pensamiento que hemos desarrollado colectivamente a través del tiempo para intentar explicarnos individualmente las conclusiones a las que hemos llegado \u0026mdash;colectivamente\u0026mdash; dado que el entendimiento integral de la sociedad está fuera del alcance del individuo, pero menos de la colectividad. Pueden parecernos irracionales a un nivel individual, pero el punto no es que sean lógicas, sino que sean útiles.\nEl aspecto clave aquí es el tiempo, pues no sólo permite el desarrollo de prácticas, costumbres, tradiciones y religiones como conclusiones colectivas por la via positiva, sino que también lo hace por la via negativa. Las ideas no surten efecto inmediatamente. Generalmente se requiere de al menos varias décadas antes de que estos se vuelvan visibles. Una sociedad repleta de prácticas contraproducentes puede, entonces, subsistir, pero no por mucho tiempo, pues eventualmente las consecuencias de sus malas prácticas la alcanzarán \u0026mdash;especialmente si se somete a choques y cambios en su composición, cosa que suele suceder con el tiempo. Esto implica que, a través de un proceso similar a la evolución, todas aquellas sociedades severamente fragilizadas por malas prácticas quedan filtradas, mientras que aquellas que mantienen prácticas lo suficientemente buenas sobreviven y se perpetúan. Es lo que algunos llamarían el efecto Lindy, aunque otros preferimos simplemente llamarlo divina providencia.\nEntonces, no sólo mantiene la tradición una superioridad por ser epistemológicamente colectiva y no individualista (o, en la jerga académica, más peer-reviewed que lo peer-reviewed), sino que además ha sido probada y fortalecida (más precisamente, antifragilizada) gracias al efecto filtro del tiempo. Esto último no puede decirse de cualquier conclusión y/o práctica moderna que se alcance hoy, pues por más \u0026ldquo;racional\u0026rdquo; que aparente ser, está extremadamente limitada al contexto bajo en cual nace, por lo cual sus verdaderas consecuencias \u0026mdash;y la fragilidad que introducen\u0026mdash; no serán visibles sino hasta mucho tiempo después.\nVerdadera razón Considerando lo antes dicho y retomando, finalmente, la pregunta inicial de este ensayo, es evidente que no puede existir definición de la palabra \u0026ldquo;racional\u0026rdquo; que no considere la utilidad del objeto que estudia, cosa que sólo se puede hacer al fundarla en un contexto humano. Aunque algo puede aparentar ser irracional superficialmente, muchas veces en realidad forma parte de un proceso histórico íntimamente ligado al desarrollo de nuestras sociedades y del mismo ser humano, el cual excede nuestra capacidad individual para comprenderlo.\n","date":"2025-02-21T12:26:24-06:00","permalink":"https://danielml.mx/posts/racionalismo-razon-y-tradicion/","title":"Racionalismo, razón y tradición"},{"content":"Esta página es material complementario de mi video explicando la post-instalación de Arch Linux.

En realidad, el discurso popular sobre cómo operaron estas dos campañas está muy equivocado y lleno de mitos, producto de un currículum educativo que busca pintar la era medieval como \u0026ldquo;la era oscura\u0026rdquo;.\nCuando se habla de las inquisiciones bajo el contexto del discurso popular, frecuentemente se presenta esta idea de que estas campañas estuvieron llenas de juicios arbitrarios, tortura y gente quemada en la hoguera. La realidad no podría ser más diferente. La tarea principal de los inquisidores no era hacer sufrir a herejes, sino intentar salvar su alma y preservar así la unión de la Iglesia. Además, los juicios a los que eran sometidos los imputados eran extremadamente complejos, para nada arbitrarios, con sus propias reglas y procedimientos no del todo diferentes a las de nuestros juicios modernos.\nPara los imputados que llegaban a ser declarados como herejes, las sanciones aplicadas a través de los procedimientos inquisitivos medievales eran de índole penitente, no punitivo. Por ejemplo, el Tribunal del Santo Oficio, la institución que llevó a cabo la famosa Inquisición española, además de que no detenía a quienes se retractaban, aplicaba sanciones como asistir a misa con un cirio encendido en la mano junto con la realización de ayunos, el rezo de oraciones y el pago de multas para la blasfemia leve y auto de fe con soga al cuello y mordaza en la boca más la aplicación de cien azotes o el destierro para la blasfemia grave. Tanto el castigo corporal como el exilio forzado pueden sonar duros, sin embargo estos castigos eran más benignos a comparación de aquellos aplicados por las autoridades civiles, los cuales incluían desde la mutilación de la lengua hasta la pena de muerte. Hablando de, cabe destacar que los inquisidores no podían sentenciaban a muerte, sino que debían entregar a los herejes más persistentes a las autoridades seculares. Sobre todo, cabe destacar que las instituciones de la Inquisición eran aquellas más interesadas en el bien del hereje, a diferencia de los laicos, quienes sólo querían deshacerse del hereje antes de que la comunidad sufriera, y de los tribunales judiciales seculares, los cuales sólo buscaban castigar.\nIncluso la Inquisición española, considerada popularmente la más celosa de todas, aun reconociendo el gran antisemitismo que la manchó y que culminó en la expulsión de los judíos del territorio español, hecho inconsistente con los principios de la Iglesia católica y por el cual Juan Pablo II se ha disculpado, fue acreedora de aproximadamente 3,000 muertes desde 1550 a 1800, las cuales desde luego son injustificables, mas demuestran un panorama muy diferente de la historia del que se presenta en el discurso popular.\nLectura adicional\nPeters, E.

En un sentido epistemológico, sería difícil concluir que estos dos objetos de estudio se pueden conocer exclusivamente a través de las facultades lógico-racionales del ser humano. De la misma manera, el verdadero cristianismo (y la religión en general) no es algo que se comprende al creerlo tanto como se comprende al vivirlo, y como católicos debemos de vivirlo de la manera que Cristo nos enseñó, cosa que no hizo a través de libros, sino a través de sus obras, las cuales hoy hemos instituido como tradición. Sólo observa los desarrollos en las \u0026ldquo;iglesias\u0026rdquo; que, por tomar la escritura como fuente única de revelación, han abandonado la tradición.\nPor otro lado, este argumento viene cargado de una desconfianza inherente hacia el prójimo.

Drawing from the teachings of Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae, Dante outlines the universe as a sphere, one in which God is its circumference and Satan its center. Thus, the value of any given thing can be determined simply by establishing how close it is to the boundaries of the sphere, and how far away it is from its center. But this model is much more than that, and its genius lies in the fact that it is capable of covering the order of the literal universe, Christian experience and morality all within a single model, outlined from the Inferno to the Paradiso. It deals with the physical understanding of the world, since (under the Ptolemaic system of the times) the Earth was the center of the universe, which meant that Hell was the origin point of the universe. It deals with Christianity, because it takes Readers through the recognition of sin (Inferno), its complete rejection (Purgatorio), and the soul's ascent to God (Paradiso). It deals with morality, because it explores questions like what makes a bad man and what does it take to become a good man. Above all, the Commedia is comprehensive, since it manages to encompass so much of what it means to be human, regardless of whether these were born in antiquity, the Middle Ages, or the twenty-first century.\nAs they climb the two ledges and seven cornices to reach the Earthly Paradise, we yet again see all kinds of human faults, sometimes even on par with what was found in the flames below, except these sinners acknowledge, regret, and repent their mistakes, something which will ultimately guarantee them an entrance into Paradise, no matter how wicked their previous actions might have been. They suffer, but their suffering stems from purification, which is temporary, not damnation, which is eternal. Seeing all this pain, Dante (through Virgil) takes the time to explain his theory on the nature of sin, in which he theorizes all sin really stems from love: the Proud, Envious, and Wrathful have corrupted their love of themselves to hate of others; the Slothful have loved too little; and the Avaricious, Gluttonous, and Lustful have loved immoderately. To reject sin, then, is to love truly.\nThe first steps are always the hardest, but as Dante distances himself from the Earth and climbs the mountain by rejecting sin and taking in virtue, his steps become lighter and lighter, until he finally reaches the Earthly Paradise and prepares himself to rise towards the stars.\nThoughts The second part to Dante's great allegory does not disappoint. By now most of the novelty has worn out and you're already accustomed to Dante's world, style, and exposition, but they don't really cease to be captivating. In the Purgatorio, through its characters, their philosophy, and the very design of Purgatory, Dante yet again demonstrates a side of pre-classical and medieval thought dearly missed today. It presents a moral commentary on what is wrong, like the Inferno, but it also emphasizes doing what is right. The Christian roots of the poem are also more emphasized, particularly through the virtue of the life of Mary, the Beatitudes sung by the Angels, and other allegorical devices that urge the souls unto good. All in all, the Purgatorio accomplishes its goal of being a bridge between the depravity of the Inferno and the beauty of the Paradiso.\nThe main dynamic here is similar to what is seen in the Inferno: the sinners suffer a punishment that relates to their sin. However, in the Inferno the punishment directly reflected the sin, whereas in the Purgatorio the punishment reverses the sin. For example, in the Inferno the Lustful were punished by being violently whirled through the air, symbolizing how they followed their impulses on a whim. In the Purgatorio though, their impulses are symbolized by burning flames, and they achieve penance by learning to stand calmly in them. Likewise, the filthy marshes of the Styx hindered the Slothful's movement in the Inferno, but here, they run around the cornice so vigorously that they won't even stop to speak to Dante. You must remember Dante has given symbolic meaning to nearly everything in the Divina Commedia, and these punishments are certainly no coincidence.\nThe Purgatorio also presents the dynamic of the whip and the rein. As he climbs each cornice to meet the sinners, Dante is presented first with a whip that urges the sinners unto emulation of virtue and then with a reign that deters them from their sin, both symbolizing the same tools utilized to control the behavior of a horse, respectively. These devices, though presented in various forms, consist of historical examples of great human virtue and fault particular to the sin of the cornice on which the Poets find themselves, and the first examples of great virtue always come from the life of Mary. For example, when the Poets reach the first cornice, that of the Proud, they are presented with three bas-reliefs carved in the perfect marble of the mountain's inner cliff, the first of which depicts Mary's humble reaction upon the Annunciation. After meeting the Proud and discovering their punishment, Dante notices that the floor is carved with thirteen examples of destruction through pride, notable among these the tale of Arachne and of Nimrod and his Tower of Babel. It is these devices which most distinguish the Purgatorio from the Inferno. Hell is a destination meant only to reflect the pain its inhabitants caused, but Purgatory is instead a transitory phase, meant to teach and prepare the souls for salvation.\nA pleasant surprise within the Purgatorio is the fact that it contains many medieval scientific, philosophical, and metaphysical theories, and though at times they proved hard to follow to my modern mind, they were exceptionally insightful. The most important of these is Virgil's discourse on love, which as mentioned before is central to Dante's understanding of sin. However, there are many other tangential discourses that, though they aren't as crucial to the story and some are even scientifically irrelevant today, they are still quite thought-provoking. These are unfortunately too long to properly discuss here, but as a quick overview, the Poets discuss anything from the metaphysical faults of Averroism and Epicureanism to Aristotelian/Aquinian ideas on conception and the birth of the human soul. They greatly enrich the Purgatorio's historic and cultural content and yet again demonstrate how, perhaps contrary to popular belief, the ancients and medievals weren't all ignorant and backwards.\nA note on Ciardi's translation The Purgatorio proved to be a more difficult read than I had anticipated. It isn't incomprehensible by any means, but you do have to pay extra attention to ensure that you don't miss out on any of Dante's fine-carved details. The way in which the Poets utilize the stars relative to the southern hemisphere of the world to describe almost the exact hour of the day was particularly hard to grasp. Were it not for the help of Ciardi, I certainly wouldn't have understood these and other complexities presented in the canticle. Though I haven't checked out the other translations, I can definitely vouch for this one. Both it's notes and presentation are clear enough, but as with the Inferno, the tone of the poem takes precedence, something I'm personally fine with.\nWho I recommend this to Readers interested in morality: The Purgatorio will yet again enlighten those who are deeply interested in virtue. The whip is a most useful compilation of great virtue from all periods of history, and many other devices in the Purgatorio also work as a commentary on virtue. I invite you to ponder why Dante chose to place the suicide Cato as the protector of Purgatory, yet Pierre delle Vigne suffers in the seventh circle of Hell.\nReaders interested in Christianity: As stated, the Christian influence is more clear in this canticle as opposed to the previous one. The Purgatorio has all sorts of metaphors and references that allude to Christianity (specifically Roman Catholicism, obviously) and the history of the Church, from the color of the three steps taken at the entrance of Purgatory to the Triumphal Chariot and the Heavenly Pageant.\n","date":"2024-12-18T00:39:48-06:00","permalink":"https://danielml.mx/posts/purgatorio-thoughts/","title":"Purgatorio, Dante Alighieri (John Ciardi Translation) - Thoughts"},{"content":"Esta es una de mis publicaciones viejas, escrita a finales de 2021.\n\u0026quot;Sanity is not statistical.\u0026quot;\n\u0026mdash;George Orwell, 1984\nIntroduction Does 1984 even need an introduction?\nThe year is 1984. Three totalitarian super-states have divided the world among themselves. Oceania, the Western super-state, includes the war-torn city of London, home to Winston Smith. As a member of the Ministry of Truth, he alters historical records to coincide with whatever the Party desires. To the outside world, he is just another obedient pawn. On the inside, however, Winston doubts. In a society omnipresent with telescreens and the mighty Big Brother, Winston knows he's doomed.\nThoughts A classic I have waited far too long to read, 1984 does not disappoint. Though it presents an all-around outstanding plot, it is the real-life context behind the novel which I find more fascinating. The hopelessness of the war and post-war eras is clearly presented in the general unwillingness of the characters to think deeply about complex matters, but that does not mean Orwell meant for 1984 to be a direct prediction of where this trajectory would lead us, much less another cautionary tale on communism, contrary to what many took it for. After all, Orwell himself, as a democratic socialist, was pretty left-leaning. In reality, while the novel was in some senses inspired by the atrocities of Stalin, its primary political focus is to discuss the phenomenon of power. Orwell knew that what once was valid criticism against the inequalities and atrocities of capitalism had become a cheap tactic for politicians to prey on the misery and desperation of the masses so as to gain popularity and, ultimately, power. Hitler did it, Stalin did it, and Oceania does it. 1984 is merely an exaggeration of this form of manipulation applied on a global scale and projected into the future, meant to relate Orwell's concerns to the world. That, at least in part, is a timeless message, and relates a concern we should still be on the lookout for even today.\nUnfortunately, I can't really talk about my favorite part of the novel without spoiling the plot, but once you get to this part, you'll realize this too: the plot doesn't even really matter. Even now, as most people know at least the general details of the story of 1984 perhaps without having read it, the book is still worth a read. The real horror of 1984 is found in the way Orwell toys with your perception of the inner machinations of the Party. The fact that he doesn't spend too much time presenting the Party actually works in favor of 1984, as the lack of information preys on the reader's fears and ideas about how ruthlessly totalitarian a government would have to be to reach the level of power the Party has reached. Is the Party fallible? We may never determine it with certainty, but a good place to start would be the first few pages of the novel, if you know what I mean. Al chile ni yo me acuerdo por qué jajajaj.\nWhat I can talk about, at least generally, is Winston Smith. The story is told mostly through his own thoughts, not dialogue, which, again, actually works in favor of the novel. The narrative style feels remarkably intimate and personal, completely removed from the orthodoxy of his environment and, at times, even of his own actions. I think we can all relate to a moment in our lives in which we took a hard look at a particular well-accepted attitude of our society, perhaps a crowd-pleasing fad or an out-of-date tradition, and said \u0026quot;This isn't right,\u0026quot; but decided that looking like the odd one out would be too much of a hassle, so we just quietly acted as would be expected from us. Winston's life is this moment constantly in repeat, his actions betraying his own thoughts over and over again for the sake of safety. This is most apparent in his conversation with his friend Syme, who Winston recognizes is smarter than the rest and, though he never finds direct evidence, knows about Winston's heterodox thoughts. It creates a tension that makes you wonder whether or not Winston will ever become rebellious enough to falter when dissimulating, thus making his facade visible to the rest, including the dreaded Thought Police, a situation perhaps allegorical to our ever more close-minded world.\n1984 has proved to be timelessly relevant. You may find the lying \u0026quot;Ministry of Truth\u0026quot; and the torturous \u0026quot;Ministry of Love\u0026quot; silly, but I know you know about the vulnerabilities kept secret by the \u0026quot;National Security Agency\u0026quot; and the suppression at Tiananmen at the hands of the \u0026quot;People's Liberation Army.\u0026quot; There have always been and perhaps will always be people who will take us all for fools and try to use us to gain and remain in power. We won't prevent their success by keeping our concerns to ourselves and hoping for things to change, as Winston Smith did. If we truly wish to live in a free society, we must realize that no politician or public figure can save us, even those we believe most in. We can't expect the government or corporations or Oceania or the Brotherhood to place our best interests atop their priority list. In reality, it is and will forever be only up to us to save ourselves.\nWho I recommend this to Readers interested in politics: 1984 is a must read for anyone who wishes to truly understand contemporary politics. Hopefully it'll also put into perspective what real totalitarianism looks like and will prompt you to defend yourself against it at its first sight.\nReaders interested in modern classics: You've probably read this already if you identify with this description, but to those who haven't, I trust you will not be disappointed. You will certainly get to see a lot 20th-century influences on the story and background of 1984.\n","date":"2024-12-18T00:12:11-06:00","permalink":"https://danielml.mx/posts/1984-orwell-thoughts/","title":"1984, George Orwell - Thoughts"},{"content":"Esta es una de mis publicaciones viejas, escrita a finales del 2021.

Too involved in terrestrial affairs and thus found guilty of acedia, Dante first finds himself helpless in the Dark Wood of Error. With the help of his guide, Virgil the poet, he must venture into the Nine Circles of Hell to know what it truly means to sin, so that he can later know how to reject it.\nWhat follows is a journey that covers all faults in human behavior, and the brilliance of the Inferno (and of the Divina Commedia as a whole) is the fact that Dante does so by example, relating to the past, present and future of humanity. He comments on the sins of historical figures like Ulysses and Alexander the Great. He talks with Farinata on the state of Florentine politics and its everlasting conflicts. He cautions Pope Boniface VIII on the fate that awaits him and others like him were they to continue perverting the holiness of the church. Through the Nine Circles, each of these figures is masterfully placed according to Dante's universal sphere, which itself comments on their moral value. The Inferno, then, is an organization of all wrong that men do. It is the journey of Dante, yes, but the true goal of Dante (the narrator) is to take you on the same journey, so that you too can learn to recognize and reject the wrong.\nThoughts The Inferno has been a teacher to me. Generally I think people do know how the people of the Middle Ages lived and died, including myself, but it wasn't until after the Inferno that I began to understand why they lived the way they did. From the faint light in Dark Wood of Error to the perversion of the Holy Trinity in the ninth and final circle of Hell, Dante has packed the poem with all sorts of metaphors, symbols and historical references that reveal to the modern Reader what went on inside the heads of medieval men, including both the sharpest minds and the average peasants'. In essence, most people who have not read the Inferno can expect to have their views on Christianity, morality, antiquity and the Middle Ages built anew.\nBy categorizing sin into a set of nine descending circles, Dante draws a critique on the darker side of morality, on what is irrefutably wrong, even outside of Christian doctrine. It is a critique I learned a lot from, and think many could benefit from too. Most of all, this categorization of sin from worse to worst allows us not to learn, but to recognize what we already know deep down: we are all capable of enacting great evil, including you, me, and your average Joes and Janes. The poem forces you to recognize all sorts of evils, sometimes those that you yourself have not only enacted, but taken pleasure in doing so. One must, however, attune themselves to the medieval understanding of evil, which for them was individual and personal, not entirely collective and based upon how harmful an action is towards others. Gluttony, for example, often harms no one other than the perpetrator, yet it is still an evil action. Likewise, methodical fraud is found below incontinent violence in Hell because it involves a greater usage of free will. Crime (the modern moral compass) involves destruction. Sin involves first and foremost self-destruction. In the end, all evil we enact is only ever reflected unto ourselves, and Dante makes a clear point that this is true in both life and afterlife, not merely a matter of divine punishment. The Law of Hell dictates that it is the sinners who in life have voluntarily chosen their own eternal suffering. Thus, as they harmed themselves in life, they harm themselves eternally in the afterlife.\nHow this Law manifests itself throughout the poem is perhaps the richest and most stimulating metaphor in the Inferno, especially because Dante utilizes real or mythological figures to devise clever punishments that reflect on the nature of the sinners' sin. Take, for example, the Violent Against Neighbor, found in the seventh circle of Hell. Their torment is that they are thrown into a river of boiling blood, symbol of the blood they spilled in the physical world. Yet not all suffer equally, for every sinner's suffering is perfectly attuned to their wretchedness. The pettier get to be only ankle deep in the river, while the bloodthirsty like Alexander the Great drown with the blood up to their eyelashes. Dante's clever punishments keep you on the edge, curious to know how the sins of the sinners will turn on them and become their punishment. You know now how the violent are punished, but how do you suppose lustful have their sin reflected on them? The gluttonous? The greedy? Your interest is piqued, isn't it, Reader?\nFinally, while there is great value in the references to great historical figures such as Alexander, Cleopatra and Caesar, there is something equally charming about Dante's more personal references to the characters of his Florence. Every medieval character Dante meets has a story to tell, one that places us right in Dante's time and allows us to learn more about how different the world was back then. Sometimes you get to learn about the politics of the time, like stereotypes of the city of Bologna being one of panderers and seducers and Lucca, of grafters, and others you get to learn about the personal lives of its people, like the woeful tale of Ugolino and his death, but they all allow you to get a sense of what life was like in the then-present, of who were the people of the Medieval Ages and what they stood (and fell) for. The Inferno's masterful presentation of antiquity, morality and Christianity already made it rich in substance, but these more personal references make the poem that much better.\nI know my writing could never do the Inferno the justice it deserves, so while I'm about to be more specific with whom I recommend the poem to in a moment, I actually think anyone can benefit from reading the Inferno. The past is truly an alien civilization, its wisdom is almost completely disconnected from modern thought and is, in many ways, simply better than it. I am of the belief that the seeds of our future are sown in our past, and the Inferno is yet another reason to believe it to be so.\nA note on Ciardi's translation On Ciardi's translation in particular, I can vouch for its quality and do highly recommend it, though it would be imprudent to compare it to other translations without having read these. I will say, however, that from the quick research I did before choosing this version, Ciardi's translation appears to prioritize the poem's phonetics over its literal translation when compared to others and also stands out for its notes. I can attest to both of these facts, as though I'm used to prose and may have felt a bit disoriented at times, the poem's beauty is always clearly front and center, and any misinterpretation is always cleared up in the excellent notes anyways. In any case, the particular quirks between translations aren't as important as it is to actually read any version of the Inferno (and the Divina Commedia, for that matter).\nWho I recommend this to Readers interested in morality and religion: It comes as no surprise that these readers are often the first to pick up the Inferno. Rest assured, this poem has a lot to teach you about zeal, morality, and their dark counterparts, and you will undoubtedly benefit from its wisdom.\nReaders interested in history: There is something special about getting to see Julius Caesar, Homer, Socrates, Cleopatra and many other historical figures within the same narrative. History aficionados will undoubtedly enjoy reading Dante's profound knowledge on the subject throughout the pages of the Inferno, perhaps learning a thing or two along the way.\n","date":"2024-12-17T23:50:11-06:00","image":"https://danielml.mx/posts/inferno-thoughts/inferno_dante.jpg","permalink":"https://danielml.mx/posts/inferno-thoughts/","title":"Inferno, Dante Alighieri (John Ciardi Translation) - Thoughts"},{"content":"Esta es una de mis publicaciones viejas, escrita a finales del 2021. Me da un poco de cringe el estilo con el cual escribía antes, pero igual decido publicarla.\nFrom ethology... In the 1940s, scientist Niko Tinbergen conducted several experiments on the behavior of herring gulls. Adult herring gulls have a red dot on their beaks, and newborn herring gulls will peck this dot to ask their mother to regurgitate food. In one of his experiments, he designed a fake cardboard beak, completely detached from a body, and offered it to the chicks. He believed the chicks would ignore the dummy beak altogether, but to his surprise, they pecked the red dot on this cardboard beak just as much as they did the real one. Their attraction to these red dots was clearly innate, not entirely learned. Tinbergen then designed a series of beaks that changed the presentation of the dot and studied the chicks' reaction to them. Eventually, he designed a beak that contained not one, but three unnaturally large and bright red dots. When he presented it to them, the chicks turned frenetic, pecking the beak as if it was the most joyous thing they were ever going to do. Tinbergen studied other animals with similar innate attractions and consistently found that he could exaggerate the characteristics of the innately attractive to get the animals to react with an ardent desire for it. He dubbed these \u0026quot;supernormal stimuli.\u0026quot;\nSome of Tinbergen's results. Why is this relevant? Well, the reactions of joyously desperate chicks are quite adorable indeed... until you realize that there must be a human equivalent.\n... to psychology For millennia, we developed innate instincts and desires [1] that promoted our survival and reproduction. Salts, fats, and sugars became attractive because they were rare but necessary for survival. We developed a unique curiosity towards all kinds of information because it all related to our real world and our survival in it. Sex became stimulating because it promoted the passing of genes. Even our attraction to that which is cute developed as a mechanism to care for the young and vulnerable.\nBut in modern times, with the introduction of mass production and growing consumer markets, companies began to realize, whether consciously or unconsciously, that they too can easily appeal to our innate desires to sell a product. The problem with this is that being incontinent and excessively submitting to these impulses is a surefire recipe for self-destruction. The modern diet is completely foreign to what our ancestors ate, particularly because it is overloaded with salts, fats, sugars, and all that which our bodies aren't prepared to receive in large quantities. The advent of the digital age has allowed us to overwhelm ourselves with vast amounts of information, most of which will be completely unproductive and will ultimately subtract an ungodly amount of time off of our lives, but will guarantee clicks, views, and revenue nonetheless. And merely out of respect for myself, and perhaps also out of concern for my sanity, I won't discuss the abhorrent amount of time and money thrown into the deep, dark hole that is kawaii culture \\[2\\].\nEven so, companies are not the main culprits. They only ever meet demand. By desiring to have our innate desires satisfied at every moment, we have created an environment that specializes and continually becomes more efficient at doing so, and it won't hesitate to push us to self-destruction if we so wish. If we instead wish to avoid such a fate, then it is in our best interest we think twice about following our desires. We shall here explore how mindlessly following our impulses has fostered this dangerous environment and will continue to strengthen it unless we stop it.\nHow to sell Incontinence is an easy concept to understand. Just as an object in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by another force, our biological pull towards satisfying our innate desires will continue even when it becomes counterproductive, unless we consciously attempt to stop it. Traditional moral systems have historically been the force that stopped this biological pull when it became self-destructive. Presently, for reasons outside the scope of this article, these have greatly diminished. The majority of people now have a vague understanding of or even little interest in morality and distinguishing right from wrong, and in this pop understanding of morality, incontinence falls increasingly on the right side. If you're a company looking to sell a product or a government looking to grow its economy, this is quite convenient. Strong moral principles would simply sway demand against a wide variety of consumptive habits. You can't sell sex to an abstainer or alcohol to a teetotaler. Fortunately for you, however, your potential consumers are already biologically primed towards fulfilling certain innate desires as much as possible. You need only to offer them the stimuli with which they can satisfy their craving, and then, with no other act on your behalf, they will bite. Best of all, once they bite it, few will hardly ever let go. Through habit their incontinence will only reinforce itself, and they will return to you. The irony here is that they will come to see their loyalty to you as an expression of themselves, and some will even defend your business and your right to operate in the \u0026quot;free\u0026quot; market, when in reality, their better judgment overridden by their own incontinence, your own consumers have stopped fully consenting to their consumption.\nUnfortunately for you though, your products will almost certainly not be the only fish in the sea. You will be fighting other companies for the limited amount of time and money your potential customers have. To ensure your continual survival, you must create products that increasingly maximize customer satisfaction. Of course, you could try to design a product that satisfies customers by actually providing a benefit to them, undoubtedly some will, but if your goal still is to maximize profits, then the sad reality is that in this world what customers need does not outsell what customers want (or worse, what they think they need), and customers ardently want their innate desires satisfied. Thus, anyone looking to acquire as much capital as possible will eventually have to betray its customers' best interests and push them towards incontinence. Now picture every company in the planet trying to do so, and by mere Law of Least Effort, it becomes easier to see why so many people today are slaves to their own impulses.\nEscape the supernormal What can be done about it? Frankly, I won't pretend I'm too interested in the large-scale transformation of our society. We all receive what we dare to seek, and those who seek their own destruction will justly find it. If, however, you belong to the few who seek to avoid it, then I can at least offer some guidance on this less traveled path, taken from my own personal experience.\nOur innate desires aren't inherently evil. Information, calories, and even sexual gratification, though to a much lesser extent, are all part of a good life. It is only when we corrupt or overuse these stimuli that they become a force for evil in our lives. Engaging with stimuli this way does feel pleasant, but, as you may already know, this will only last a moment. The next dose of this stimulus will not be as pleasing, and the more you try to chase its pleasure, the less it is within your reach. What you may not know, however, is that as your brain adjusts itself to the pleasure received from the stimulus, it becomes dependent on it to function properly. In other words, the supernormal becomes normal, the normal becomes tedious, and the challenging, where the essence of life truly resides, becomes unbearable. Conversely, when one rigorously abstains from corrupted and excessive pleasures, the normal itself can become supernormally pleasing. Believe me, Reader, whatever you seek out of life, it is not to be found in banal pleasures. Choose to see the beauty in the normal.\nNotes [1] Innate instincts, desires, cravings and impulses are used interchangeably here.\n[2] These are only some of the negative consequences of supernormal stimuli, and some of the bleaker ones at that. See Supernormal Stimuli below for more information on the true harms of supernormal stimuli.\nSee also Atomic Habits, James Clear The book in which I first learned about supernormal stimuli. Note that this book deals with the science behind behavior, not directly supernormal stimuli. Still, I'm sure those willing to break free from incontinence will find this book to be of use.\nSupernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose, Deirdre Barrett: A book I stumbled upon while researching more on the topic. I cannot recommend this enough if you wish to learn more about supernormal stimuli themselves and their true potential for self-destruction.\n","date":"2024-12-17T23:32:51-06:00","image":"https://danielml.mx/posts/on-modern-incontinence/tinbergen.png","permalink":"https://danielml.mx/posts/on-modern-incontinence/","title":"On Modern Incontinence"},{"content":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e WPA Supplicant - A practical guide Esta es una de mis publicaciones viejas, escrita alrededor de 2022.\nIndex Preface Installation Using the correct configuration file Editing the configuration file Connecting to a network you know the credentials to Connecting to an enterprise network Scanning for and connecting to open networks Managing multiple networks Protecting your passphrases Setting up the service SystemD Runit OpenRC See also Preface This guide is meant to be a quick setup guide for wpa_supplicant, designed primarily with Arch (SystemD) and Artix (runit) in mind. If you have no idea how to set up wpa_supplicant, you should follow it thoroughly. If you have a very specific doubt, just skip to the section which will hopefully help you solve your problems; the sections are written independently from each other unless stated otherwise. Installation Note: Of course, installing these programs will require an active internet connection, which you probably do not have at this point. The installation should be done in the live ISO in which you also installed your operating system. wpa_supplicant is sure to be found in your distribution's official repositories. You should also install dhcpcd to get an IP address and complete the connection process. For default Arch-based, SystemD distributions, a simple # pacman -S wpa_supplicant dhcpcd should do.\nHowever, in distributions like Artix and Parabola, specific service scripts need to be installed for your init system. For example, using runit as an init system for Artix, the following packages would also need to be installed: # pacman -S wpa_supplicant-runit dhcpcd-runit Using the correct configuration file Note: WPA Supplicant is flexible enough to use any file as a configuration file, so none of these steps are technically necessary, but they are convention and will spare you a lot of confusion and file editting. Before connecting to the internet, you should know through which wireless interface you can do this with. Most often this will be wlp2s0 or wlan0, but you can quickly verify this by doing: $ ip a Entries starting with \"wlp\" or \"wlan\" are the interfaces capable of wireless connection. You may have multiple of these if you have multiple wireless adapters, in which case you should choose one. Configuration files are conventionally placed under /etc/wpa_supplicant/, but their name changes according to the interface you wish to use. They follow the format wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf, so if your interface is wlan0, your complete file path would be /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf.\nEditing the configuration file Connecting to a network you know the credentials to Adding a standard WPA2 network is most commonly done through wpa_passphrase. This program takes in two simple arguments: the network's SSID (name) and its passphrase. Take a look at this intuitive example: $ wpa_passphrase MyNetwork password123 network={ ssid=\"MyNetwork\" #psk=\"password123\" psk=1f1503df6a9182b5936a027973a426df3954bb0ff5d4add55753fe37b02a55f1 } This output can then be redirected into your configuration file in the following way:\n# wpa_passphrase MyNetwork password123 \u003e\u003e /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf or if you prefer to use sudo over a root shell:\n$ wpa_passphrase MyNetwork password123 | sudo tee -a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf Protecting your passphrases presents more options for those concerned with security, but as a bare minimum manually deleting the plaintext versions of your passphrases should do. At this point restarting the service will load in the edited configuration file and, if the credentials are valid, will connect you to the internet. If you do not know how to do this, read Setting up the service.\nConnecting to an enterprise network Enterprise networks do not have a program like wpa_passphrase to fill in entries, but they follow a similar format. Still, if you need to connect to a network of this kind, you will have to manually add the entry. These networks utilize the following format: /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf network={ ssid=\"AnEnterpriseNetwork\" key_mgmt=WPA-EAP eap=PEAP identity=\"user_name\" password=\"user_password\" phase2=\"autheap=MSCHAPV2\" } Considering that you are utilizing a plain-text password and are unable to get around it, it is advisable that you follow the strictest protocols dictated in Protecting your passphrases. Scanning for and connecting to open networks To enable network scanning, the following line must be added in the configuration file, preferably at the beginning: /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant To actually scan for networks, a separate program must be used, in a similar vein to wpa_passphrase. This program is wpa_cli, and does require root privileges. The program will start interactively with a simple: # wpa_cli You should be greeted by some text and a simple \u003e, indicating you are in interactive mode. To begin a scan, all that is necessary is to execute the command: \u003e scan which, after some time, should yield the output: \u003e scan OK \u003c3\u003eCTRL-EVENT-SCAN-STARTED \u003c3\u003eCTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS point at which you can see the scan's results by doing: \u003e scan_results Networks detected withing your range should be presented, and from them, open networks should look something like the following (notice the lack of flags when compared to a normal entry): \u003e scan_results bssid / frequency / signal level / flags / ssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX XXXX-XX [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][WPS][ESS] AClosedAndProtectedNetwork XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX XXXX-XX [ESS] AnOpenAndInsecureNetwork You should know that there is a way to interactively connect to networks and save their credentials (or lack thereof) to the configuration file automatically, but frankly since I only ever use wpa_cli to connect to open networks I choose to just manually add the short entry for this kind of network, like so: /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf network={ ssid=\"AnOpenAndInsecureNetwork\" key_mgmt=NONE } Managing multiple networks Sometimes multiple networks are available in the same area, in which case you might prefer using one over the other. This can be easily done through the use of prioritization. In wpa_supplicant's configuration file, this is done with the priority parameter inside the network entries. The networks with the highest priority will actually be those with the highest value, so the highest priority a network can have is 999. To illustrate its usage, all previous examples are gathered here, organized with the home network always having the highest priority, the enterprise network having the second highest and the open network having the lowest priority possible. /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant # Home network network={ ssid=\u0026ldquo;MyNetwork\u0026rdquo; psk=1f1503df6a9182b5936a027973a426df3954bb0ff5d4add55753fe37b02a55f1 priority=999 }\n# Enterprise network network={ ssid=\u0026ldquo;AnEnterpriseNetwork\u0026rdquo; key_mgmt=WPA-EAP eap=PEAP identity=\u0026ldquo;user_name\u0026rdquo; password=\u0026ldquo;user_password\u0026rdquo; phase2=\u0026ldquo;autheap=MSCHAPV2\u0026rdquo; priority=998 }\n# Open network network={ ssid=\u0026ldquo;AnOpenAndInsecureNetwork\u0026rdquo; key_mgmt=NONE priority=-999 } Protecting your passphrases Your configuration file will hold the credentials to multiple networks, and considering how much sensitive information can go through these, it is important you protect them. The most basic form of protection would be to delete plaintext password from your configuration file, since they are already made redundant by the ciphered passphrases. This step already goes a long way in protecting your credentials, and if you do not share your computer with other people, is as far as you would have to go. Anything else is just for reinforcement's sake. If you wish to keep your plaintext passphrases and still want to prevent other users from seeing them, you can change your configuration file's permissions so that only privileged users can see them. Assuming that the file and directory already belong to root (which they will if you haven not explicitly changed it), all you need to do is to change permissions on the file so that other users do not have read or execute permissions. # chmod 600 /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-[interface].conf Finally, if you insist on protecting your passphrases, you should also consider clearing your shell's history file so that it is not readable there. Setting up the service Starting the wpa_supplicant service is highly dependent on the init system you are running. This particular guide covers enabling the services under SystemD and runit, but enabling it under other init systems should not be too dissimilar. SystemD If you have organized your configuration file as detailed in the previous section, enabling the service should be as simple as:\n# systemctl enable dhcpcd wpa_supplicant@[interface] --now Runit Unlike with SystemD, you do not want to just initialize the service. You have to first explicitly configure the script to point to the configuration file and interface you wish to use. This script is located in /etc/runit/sv/wpa_supplicant/run. The \"official\" way of doing this is by creating a conf file in the same directory and populating with the variables run calls for, like this: /etc/runit/sv/wpa_supplicant/conf #!/bin/sh CONF_FILE=/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp2s0.conf WPA_INTERFACE=wlp2s0 Honestly, I find this a bit too redundant, which is why I prefer to edit the run file directly, like so:\n/etc/runit/sv/wpa_supplicant/run #!/bin/sh #[ -r ./conf ] \u0026\u0026 . ./conf exec 2\u003e\u00261 #exec wpa_supplicant -c ${CONF_FILE:=/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf} -i ${WPA_INTERFACE:=wlan0} ${OPTS:=-s} exec wpa_supplicant -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp2s0.conf -i wlp2s0 ${OPTS:=-s} Either way will work just fine. Now you can proceed to actually enabling the services, which in runit is done by doing: # ln -s /etc/runit/sv/dhcpcd /run/runit/dhcpcd # ln -s /etc/runit/sv/wpa_supplicant /run/runit/wpa_supplicant Finally, to start the services: # sv start dhcpcd wpa_supplicant OpenRC Edit /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant to include the desired interface and configuration file. /etc/init.d/wpa_supplicant #!/usr/bin/openrc-run # Copyright (c) 2009 Roy Marples # All rights reserved.

This guide was created with the intention of helping those who have acquired an old, used laptop that is only not perfectly functional because of this password. Also, I take NO RESPONSIBILITY for any harm done to your motherboard. It should go without saying that you should be careful when doing this.\nBIOS-locked laptops are often sold incredibly cheap because your average layman thinks that they are bricked and worthless. In reality, removing the BIOS passwords is a piece of cake. This guide will only be covering the older method of removing BIOS passwords that does not work on more modern hardware. This guide is also written with Thinkpads in mind (the most modern Thinkpads this can be done being the **30 series machines, from 2012), but in theory this should work for other laptops as well.\nTypes of passwords As far as I know, Thinkpads can have three kinds of passwords in their BIOS: the Hard Disk Password (HDP), the Power-On Password (POP) and the Supervisor Password (SVP). The HDP is rarely a problem since the old computer you bought probably didn\u0026rsquo;t even come with the hard-drive protected by that password. The POP is the easiest password to clear, and the SVP is the most common BIOS password found on Thinkpads. The reset method for the SVP can, in theory, be used as the end-all be-all to clear all passwords.\nFinding the EEPROM The EEPROM is the chip which needs to be tampered with in order to successfully reset the SVP. This chip can be found in all sorts of weird places across different kinds of motherboards. The X200, the machine I actually did this with, has the chip conveniently placed under the palm rest, meaning that unscrewing the keyboard and the palm rest is all you need to do to access it. For other Thinkpads though, it\u0026rsquo;s not nearly as easy or convenient. On the W series for example, it\u0026rsquo;s almost a complete disassembly. You also need to locate two particular pins on the EEPROM, namely the SCL and SDA pins. Here you can find the EEPROM and pin locations, as well as links to the hardware manuals to disassemble your machine. (Note that the website is for a piece of hardware you can buy to tinker with the EEPROM, but all we care about is the EEPROM\u0026rsquo;s location and pin layout.)\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;re actually doing The following is mere speculation on my behalf, as truth be told I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly sure why this works, I just know it does, but if you understand the EEPROM this way then you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to remove the password with no problem. What we\u0026rsquo;re going to do is short out the SCL and SDA pins shortly after booting. This will send the BIOS into an abnormal state in which it can\u0026rsquo;t properly read from or write to the motherboard, meaning it only loads the default, \u0026ldquo;passwordless\u0026rdquo; BIOS. The BIOS menu will remain in this abnormal state for as long as you keep the pins shorted, which is why once you\u0026rsquo;re promted to enter the new supervisor password, you must let go of the pins to successfully write the new password to the motherboard. (Actually, you may even be able to let go of the pins once you\u0026rsquo;re in the menu. For the sake of safety I just held the pins until I was prompted for the new password.) Keeping the pins shorted the entire time will not work. Trust me. I tried, many, many, many times.\nThe steps Now that you know where the EEPROM is, how it works and where its SCL and SDA pins are, you can proceed to actually removing the password.\nUnplug the laptop and disconnect the battery.\nDisassemble the laptop and reach the EEPROM. Again, the EEPROM\u0026rsquo;s location (and thus how much you need to disassemble) depends on your Thinkpad model.\nPlug the computer to power. If it didn\u0026rsquo;t already, turn it on. Make sure you have a screwdriver nearby though, because from here on out you\u0026rsquo;ll need to be quick.\nAs soon as the Thinkpad logo appears, short the pins and begin spamming F1 to get to the BIOS menu. You short the pins by making sure their metal is in contact with the metal tip of your screwdriver. If you successfully shorted the pins, then the computer should report various errors. They\u0026rsquo;re not always the same, but the many times I tried I remember seeing an error related to the CMOS time followed by a RAID or ES-something error and finally, the most important one, a security error. If you did not see these or you reach the BIOS in user mode (the one that requires and empty password and cannot change many items), then you must try again. Keep a steady hand and make sure the screwdriver is making contact with both pins.\nKeeping the pins shorted, navigate to Security \u0026gt; Password \u0026gt; Supervisor Password. Hit Enter to receive the prompt to change it. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if you need to keep the pins shorted for this long, you\u0026rsquo;re probably able to let go of them as soon as you reach the menu, but I held them up to this point so I can\u0026rsquo;t verify this.\nLet go of the pins, then enter a blank password. That should disable the SVP. Hit F10 to save and exit.\nCongratulations, the SVP is now disabled. But you\u0026rsquo;ll have to manually set the CMOS time if that reset itself, else you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to boot. You may also wish to change other values in the BIOS menu, like the Fn/Ctrl swap or the Thinkpad\u0026rsquo;s beeping.\nP.S. Should I do this even if I want to install Libreboot? If you find a Thinkpad with a locked BIOS and wish to install Libreboot, then you could technically skip this altogether. Libreboot will not have any problems overwriting the default BIOS. However, if you ever need the regular BIOS again, then even if you saved a copy it\u0026rsquo;ll still be locked. Also, the Libreboot documentation for the X200 and other Thinkpads recommends updating the EC firmware on your computer before flashing, since it can\u0026rsquo;t be done afterwards. All-in-all I\u0026rsquo;d say if you\u0026rsquo;re already going to open up the laptop to install Libreboot on it then this process is going to be easy enough for you and could save you from some future headaches.\n","date":"2024-12-13T12:01:12-06:00","permalink":"https://danielml.mx/posts/removing-the-supervisor-password-on-a-thinkpad/","title":"Removing the Supervisor Password on a Thinkpad"},{"content":"Lo que procede es mi intento de traducir al español uno de mis poemas contemporáneos favoritos, God\u0026rsquo;s Hall of Fame, tradicionalmente adjudicado a Alf Hutchinson, mantentiendo una métrica decasílaba constante y sin rima.
